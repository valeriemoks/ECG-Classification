Project Description:

Title: ECG Classification using Machine Learning

Overview:
This GitHub repository hosts a project focused on the automated classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) data using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. Cardiovascular diseases, particularly heart arrhythmia, are significant contributors to global morbidity and mortality. Our project aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of ECG classification, addressing the challenges associated with manual interpretation and subjective diagnoses.

Key Features:

Implementation of 1-D Convolutional Neural Network (1-D CNN) for tabular ECG data.
Integration of VGG-16 for image-based ECG classification.
Dataset fusion from PTB-XL ECG Database and MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.
Achieved an impressive classification accuracy of 89.01% with 1-D CNN and 97% with VGG-16.
Addressed challenges such as dataset integration issues and computational complexity.
Benefits:

Reduction in healthcare personnel workload.
Minimization of manual interpretation errors.
Improved patient outcomes and reduced burden of cardiovascular diseases globally.
Facilitation of rapid and accurate detection of cardiac arrhythmia.
Future Directions:
